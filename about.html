    <!-- Content Section -->



    <!-- I want to work on setting up this section in the same way that it is on the sample website
        ex: spacing, etc. because there is too much space in the middle of festival and guitar sections 
    
    Remember to insert small borders between each section.
    gonna need to figure out if we need one single div for the entire section or do they need
    to be separate divs in order to achieve the same spacing as the example website

    <h2>Hobbies that I enjoy in my freetime.</h2>

    <div class="music-div">

        <h3>Music Festivals</h3>
        <p>I have been going to music festivals for about 3 years now, and it was one of the best <br> decisions of
            my
            life. I enjoy the atmosphere of a music festival and all the amazing people you will end up meeting.
            <br>
            One of my dream music festivals to attend is in Europe, and it's called Tommorowland. <br> I hope this
            music
            festival journey will bring me to my dream festival one day!

        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>One of my favorite things to do when I need a break is play video games. <br> I started as a kid, with my
            first
            console being a playstation. <br> After that, I would go on to get multiple consoles, and finally reach
            the
            title
            of a PC gamer. <br> I enjoy many genres of video games such as, single-player RPG games. <br>One of my
            favorite
            single-player RPG games is called Fallout 4.</p>

        <h3>Playing Guitar</h3>
        <p>Playing electric guitar is such a fun hobby to have. <br> At first, learning how to play will be very
            difficult, but with enough practice, it becomes addicting. <br> My inspiration for playing was all the
            bands
            I would listen to in High School. <br> I enjoy playing alot of metal based songs, but have wanted to
            learn
            more acosutic style songs. <br> Eventually, I want to be able to play lead guitar with very difficult
            solos.
