                <p>I have been going to music festivals for about 3 years now, and it was one of the best <br> decisions
                    of
                    my
                    life. I enjoy the atmosphere of a music festival and all the amazing people you will end up meeting.
                    <br>
                    One of my dream music festivals to attend is in Europe, and it's called Tommorowland. <br> I hope
                    this
                    music
                    festival journey will bring me to my dream festival one day!

                <p>One of my favorite things to do when I need a break is play video games. <br> I started as a kid,
                    with my
                    first
                    console being a playstation. <br> After that, I would go on to get multiple consoles, and finally
                    reach
                    the
                    title
                    of a PC gamer. <br> I enjoy many genres of video games such as, single-player RPG games. <br>One of
                    my
                    favorite
                    single-player RPG games is called Fallout 4.</p>

                <p>Playing electric guitar is such a fun hobby to have. <br> At first, learning how to play will be very
                    difficult, but with enough practice, it becomes addicting. <br> My inspiration for playing was all
                    the
                    bands
                    I would listen to in High School. <br> I enjoy playing alot of metal based songs, but have wanted to
                    learn
                    more acosutic style songs. <br> Eventually, I want to be able to play lead guitar with very
                    difficult
                    solos.
